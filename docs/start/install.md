## Install

There are a few different ways to install Beaker:

- Download a
[release](https://github.com/allenai/beaker/releases) and extract it:

    ```bash
    tar -xvzf beaker_*.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
    ```

    Place the binary executable in your PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin).

- macOS users can install Beaker through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with a custom tap:

    ```bash
    brew tap allenai/homebrew-beaker https://github.com/allenai/homebrew-beaker.git
    brew install beaker
    ```

- [GoLang](https://golang.org/) developers can install Beaker from source using standard tools:

    ```bash
    go get -u github.com/allenai/beaker/...
    ```

## Configure and Test

To set up Beaker, log in to [beaker.org](https://beaker.org) and follow the instructions in your [account](https://beaker.org/user) page.

## Docker

You will need to install Docker to use Beaker.  Docker provides a repeatable environment for your application so Beaker can run it on any machine.

Please install the appropriate Docker Desktop version from the [Docker site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), following Docker's instructions.

## Next step

When you have your Beaker.org account, Beaker, and Docker each installed and configured, proceed to [your first experiment](experiment.md) to learn the fundamentals of experiments with Beaker.
